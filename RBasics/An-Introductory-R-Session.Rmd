# Introduction

The following section is intended to give you a first feeling what **R** [@RCore2021]
is and how it works. It assumes that the following software is installed:

1. The R system for statistical computing:  https://www.r-project.org
2. R Studio, a program that makes working with R more convenient: https://www.rstudio.org

Note: please install **R** first before installing **RStudio**.

You may also consider to watch a Youtube video about **R**, a
good example for the very beginning is the short video
"R tutorial - The True Basics of R"
from DataCamp, see https://youtu.be/SWxoJqTqo08. Besides this, 
[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) offers 
excellent **R** tutorials, part of them free of cost. Another useful **R** tutorial 
can be found at [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/r/).

# First Steps

## Program start and help system

The easiest way to learn **R** is the creative understanding and
modification of given examples, the usage of **R** for solving
practical problems and the diagnosis of the frequently occurring problems and
error messages. Don't worry: error messages are a normal phenomenon in
scientific computing and not an indication of a dysfunction of the
computer or the human brain. The opposite is true,
a certain amount of stress hormones helps to acquire permanent
learning effects.  Then, after a certain level of experience reading
the official **R**-Documentation "An Introduction to R" [@Venables2021].
or any good **R**-book is strongly recommended.

The first sections of this "crash course" are intended to give an
overview over some of the most important elements of **R** and an
insight into a typical work flow, that may be useful for the first
statistical analyses and as a starting point for self-education.

We begin our first session by starting **RStudio**, a platform
independent interface that makes working with R easier. RStudio
divides the screen into 3 (resp. 4) windows (called panes), where some
of them have additional tabs to switch between different views.

![](img/rstudio.png)

**Figure 1:** R Studio with 4 panes. Use **File -- New R Script** to open the the source 
code pane (shown top left). Then enter some code and don't forget to explore the help files.


In a fresh RStudio session, one "Pane" should be the main help page
of **R**.  It is a good idea to browse a little bit around to get an
impression about the amount and the typical style of the available
help topics.  The most important sections are "An Introduction to
R", "Search Engine \& Keywords", "Packages", the "Frequently
Asked Questions" and possibly "**R** Data Import/Export".

We start now to explore the **R**-System itself.



## R as a pocket calculator

Entering an arithmetic expression like this:

```{r pocketcalc, eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
2 + 4
```

shows that **R** can be used as a pocket calculator, that immediately
outputs the result:

```{r pocketcalc, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
```

Instead of printing the result to the screen, it is also possible to
save the result into a named **variable** using the assignment
operator "`<-`".

```{r eval=TRUE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
a <- 2 + 4
```

It seems that nothing happens, but the result is now saved in the
variable `a` that can be recalled at any time by entering the
variable name alone:

```{r fig=FALSE,echo=TRUE,keep.source=TRUE}
a
```


Variable names in **R** start always with a character (or for special
purposes a dot), followed by further characters, numerals, dots or
underscores, where a distinction is made between small and capital
letters, i.e. the variables `value`, `Value` and `VALUE` can
contain different data.  A few character combinations are **reserved
words** and cannot be used as variables: 

`break`, `for`, `function`,
  `if`, `in`, `next`, `repeat`, `while` and "`...`" (three
dots). 

Other identifiers like `plot` can be re-defined, but
this should be done with care to avoid unwanted confusion and side effects.


## Vectors

You may have noticed, that the output of the example above had a
leading `[1]`, which means that the line begins with the first
element of `a`.  This brings us to a very important feature of
**R** that variables can contain more than single values:
vectors, matrices, lists, data frames (tables) and so on.


The most basic data type is the vector, that can be filled with data
using the `c` (combine) function:

```{r eval=TRUE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
values <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 8.3, 10)
values
```

To create a sequence of values, one can use the `:` (colon):

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

or, even more flexibly the `seq` function:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x <- seq(2, 4, 0.25)
x
```

Sequences of repeated equal values can be obtained with `rep`:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x <- rep(2, 4)
x
```

## Exercise

There are many ways to use these functions, try for example:

```{r eval=FALSE,fig=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
seq(0, 10)
seq(0, 10, by = 2)
seq(0, pi, length = 12)
rep(c(0, 1, 2, 4, 9), times = 5)
rep(c(0, 1, 2, 4, 9), each = 2)
rep(c(0, 1, 2, 4, 9), each = 2, times = 5)
```

## Access to vector elements

Instead of accessing vectors as a whole, it is also possible to
extract single elements, where the index of the requested data is
itself a vector:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
values[5]
values[2:4]
values[c(1, 3, 5)]
```

Sometimes, elements of a vector may have individual names, which makes
it easy to access them:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
named <- c(a = 1, b = 2.3, c = 4.5)
named
named["a"]
```

In **R** (and in contrast to other languages like **C/C++**) vector indices
start with 1.  Negative indices are also possible, but they have the
special purpose to delete one or several elements:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
values[-3]
```

It is also possible to extend a given vector by preceding or appending
values with the combine function (`c`):

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
c(1, 1, values, 0, 0)
```

The length of a vector can be determined with:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
length(values)
```

and it is also possible to have empty vectors, i.e. vectors that
exist, but do not contain any values. Here the keyword `NULL`
means "nothing" in contrast to "0" (zero) that has length 1:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
values <- NULL
values
length(values)
```

Such empty vectors are sometimes used as "containers" for appending
data step by step:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
values <- NULL
values
length(values)
values <- c(values, 1)
values
values <- c(values, 1.34)
values
```

If a data element should be removed completely, this can be done using
the `remove` function:

```
rm(values)
values
Error: Object "values" not found
```

The complete workspace can be deleted from the menu of **R** or **RStudio** (Session -- Clear workspace) or
from the command line with `rm` (remove):

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
```

The **R** session can be closed by using the menu as usual or by
entering:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
q()
```

Sometimes and depending of the configuration, **R** asks whether the
"**R** workspace" should be saved to the disk. This may
be useful for continuing work at a later time, but has the risk to
clutter the workspace and to get irreproducible results at a later
session, so it is recommended to say "No" for now, except if you
exactly know why.

Later we will learn how to save only the data (and commands) that are
needed.


# Graphics

## R as function plotter

Now, we will see how to use **R** as a function plotter by drawing
sine or cosine functions within an interval between 0 to 10. First,
we create two vectors with `x` and `y`. To obtain 
a smooth curve, it is reasonable to choose a small step size. As
a rule of thumb I always recommend to use about 100...400 small steps
as a good compromise between smoothness and memory requirements, so
let's set the step size to 0.1:

```{r eval=TRUE, fig=TRUE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
x <- seq(0, 10, 0.1)
y <- sin(x)
plot(x, y)
```

Instead of plotting points, we can also draw
continuous lines.  This is indicated by supplying an optional argument
`type = "l"`.  

**Note:** the symbol used here for
`type` is the **small letter "L"** for "line" and not
the -- in printing very similar -- numeral "1" (one)!

We see also, that optional arguments like `type` can be given as
"keyword = value" pair. This has the advantage that the order of
arguments does not matter, because arguments are referenced by their name:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
plot(x, y, type = "l")
```

Now we want to add a cosine function with another color. This can be
done with one of the function `lines` or `points`, for
adding lines or points to an existing figure:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
y1 <- cos(x)
lines(x, y1, col = "red")
```

With the help of `text` it is also possible to add arbitrary
text, by specifying first the x and y coordinates and then the text:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
x1 <- 1:10
text(x1, sin(x1), x1, col = "green")
```

Many options exist to modify the behavior of most graphics functions
so the following specifies user-defined coordinate limits
(`xlim`, `ylim`), axis labels and a heading (`xlab`, `ylab`,
`main`).

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
plot(x, y, xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim = c(-2, 2),
    xlab = "x-Values", ylab = "y-Values", main = "Example Graphics")
```

**Code formatting and line breaks**

The above example shows a rather long command that may not fit on a single
line.  In such cases, **R** displays a `+` (plus sign) to
indicate that a command must be continued, e.g. because a closing
parenthesis or a closing quote is still missing. Such a `+` at
the beginning of a line is an automatic "prompt" similar to the
ordinary `>` prompt and must never be typed in manually. If, however, the
`+` continuation prompt occurs by accident, press "ESC" to cancel this mode.

In contrast to the long line continuation prompt, it is also possible
to write several commands on one line, separated by a semi-colon
"`;`". This is unseful in some cases, but as a general rule it is much better to 
use the script editor and then to:

* write each command to a separate line
* avoid long lines with more than about 80 characters
* use proper indentation, e.g. 2 characters per indentation level
* use spacing to improve readability of the code, e.g. before and after the assignment operator ` <- `.

Finally, a number symbol (or hash) `#` means that a complete line or the
part of the line that follows `#` is a comment and should be
ignored by **R**.

## Additional plotting options

In order to explore the wealth of graphical functions, you may now
have a more extensive look into the online help, especially regarding
`?plot` or `?plot.default`, and you should experiment a
little bit with different plotting parameters, like `lty`,
`pch`, `lwd`, `type`, `log` etc. **R**
contains uncountable possibilities to get full control over the style
and content of your graphics, e.g. with user-specified axes
(`axis`), legends (`legend`) or user-defined lines and
areas (`abline`, `rect`, `polygon`). The general
style of figures like (font size, margins, line width) can be
influenced with the `par` function.

## High level plotting functions

In addition, **R** and its packages contain numerous "high
level"-graphics functions for specific purposes.  To demonstrate a
few, we first generate a data set with normally distributed random
numbers (`mean = 0`, standard deviation `sd = 1`), then we plot them and create a
histogram.  Here, the function `par(mfrow = c(2, 2))` divides the
plotting area into 2 rows and 2 columns to show 4 separate
figures:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
x <- rnorm(100)
plot(x)
hist(x)
```

Now, we add a so-called *normal probability plot* and a second
histogram with relative frequencies together with the bell-shaped
density curve of the standard normal distribution. The optional
argument `probability = TRUE` makes sure that the histogram has
the same scaling as the density function, so that both can be
overlayed:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
qqnorm(x)
qqline(x, col = "red")
hist(x, probability = TRUE)
xx <- seq(-3, 3, 0.1)
lines(xx, dnorm(xx, 0, 1), col = "red")
```

<!-- and the same as hidden code chunk for a figure -->
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)
plot(x)
hist(x)
qqnorm(x)
qqline(x, col = "red")
hist(x, probability = TRUE)
xx <- seq(-3, 3, 0.1)
lines(xx, dnorm(xx, 0, 1), col = "red")
```


Here it may also be a good chance to do a little bit summary
statistics like: z.B. `mean(x)`, `var(x)`,
`sd(x)`, `range(x)`, `summary(x)`,
`min(x)`, `max(x)`, ...

Or we may consider to test if the generated random numbers `x`
are approximately normal distributed using the Shapiro-Wilks-W-Test:

```{r fig=FALSE,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
```


```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(100)
shapiro.test(x)
```

A p-value bigger than 0.05 tells us that the test has no objections
against normal distribution of the data.  The concrete results may
differ, because `x` contains random numbers, so it makes sense
to repeat this several times. It can be also useful compare these
normally distributed random numbers generated with `rnorm` with
uniformly distributed random numbers generated with `runif`:


```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
y <- runif(100)
plot(y)
hist(y)
qqnorm(y)
qqline(y, col="red")
mean(y)
var(y)
min(y)
max(y)
hist(y, probability=TRUE)
yy <- seq(min(y), max(y), length = 50)
lines(yy, dnorm(yy, mean(y), sd(y)), col = "red")
shapiro.test(y)
```

At the end, we compare the pattern of both data sets with
box-and-whisker plots:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
boxplot(x, y)
```

## Exercises

Repeat this example with new random numbers and
vary sample size (`n`), mean value (`mean`) and standard
deviation (`sd`) for random numbers created with `rnorm`, and use different
`min` and `max` for `runif`. Consult the help
pages for an explanation of the functions and its arguments, and create boxplots
with different data sets.

# Basic Data Structures of **R**

In addition to vectors, **R** contains several other classes of objects
for saving data, e.g. `matrix`, `array`, `list` or `data.frame`.
Both, "base **R**" and contributed packages contain many more classes. 
It is also possible to define own user-defined classes.

Under certain circumstances some of data types can be converted into each
other, e.g. by using functions like `as.matrix`, `as.vector`, 
`as.data.frame` and so on.


## Numeric and character vectors

All data objects have the two built-in attributes `mode` (data type)
and `length` (number of data in the object).

Modes can be "numeric" for calculations or "character" for text elements. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1, 3, 4, 5)       # numeric
a <- c("hello", "world") # character
```

The following is also a character variable, because the numbers are given in 
quotes. It is then not possible to do calculations:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c("1", "3", "4", "5")  # character
sum(x)

Error in sum(x) : invalid 'type' (character) of argument
```
Here it is necessary to convert the character to numeric first:

```{r eval=TRUE}
y <- as.numeric(x)
sum(y)
```

## Factors

A special kind of mode is `factor`. This is, statistically speaking, a nominal variable
that appears like characters (e.g. "control", "treatment A", "treatment B" ...),
but its **levels** are internally encoded as integer. 
Conversion of such factors into other data types should be done with care, because
a character "123" may be encoded with another value (e.g. 1) and not 123, see the following
demonstration of a correct and wrong factor conversions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 5, 8)
f <- as.factor(x)
as.numeric(f)               # wrong !!!
as.numeric(as.character(f)) # correct
as.numeric(levels(f))[f]    # even better
```

Such a factor coding is not specific to **R** and appears also in other
statistics packages. Then they are sometimes called "dummy variables".

## Matrices and arrays

A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure that can be used for matrix algebra. 
To create a matrix, we can first create a one-dimensional vector and then reformat 
it as two-dimensional matrix with `nrow` rows and `ncol`columns:

```{r}
x <- 1:20
x

y <- matrix(x, nrow = 5, ncol = 4)
y
```

We see that the matrix is filled rowwise. We can also convert it back to a vector:

```{r}
as.vector(y) # flattens the matrix to a vector
```

An `array` extends the matrix concept to more than two dimensions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- array(1:24, dim=c(3, 4, 2))
```

Vectors, matrices and arrays have an important limitation: they can only contain 
one data type (mode), either numeric or character. So, if a single element is of 
type character, the whole matrix will be of mode character and appears in quotes:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 5, 2, "a")
mode(x)
x
```


## Lists

The most flexible data type of **R** is the list. It can contain arbitrary data
of different modes. Lists can be nested to form a tree-like structure:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
l <- list(x = 1:3, y = c(1,2,3,4), a = "hello", L = list(x = 1, y = 2))
```

Lists are extremely powerful and flexible and may be discussed later. The impatient 
may have a look at the tutorial of [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_lists.asp).

## Data frames

The typical data structure for data analysis in **R** is the so-called `data.frame`. 
It can contain both, columns with numeric data and columns of mode character.
Some packages use ando extended versions of data frames, a so called `tibble`s.

A data frame can be constructed from scratch directly in the **R** code 
or read from a file or the internet. As an example, students were asked in 
different years for their favorite number from one to 9. 
The results can be put in a data frame like follows:

```{r}
favnum <- data.frame(
  favorite = 1:9,
  obs2019  = c(1, 1, 6, 2, 2,  5,  8, 6, 3),
  obs2020  = c(1, 2, 8, 1, 2,  2, 20, 2, 4),
  obs2021  = c(2, 6, 8, 1, 6,  4, 13, 2, 4),
  obs2022  = c(2, 3, 7, 8, 2, 10, 12, 6, 1)
) 
```


# Entering Data

Several different methods exist to input data into **R**.  The most
important are extensively explained in a special manual [**R** Data
Import/Export](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-data.html) 
and we want to show only a selection here:


1. direct input in the **R** code (see example above)
2. input from a text file
3. input from a spreadsheet file (LibreOffice or Excel)
4. input from a text file on the internet
5. input from a data base


Furthermore, it is possible to import of data from other
statistics packages like SPSS, SAS or Stata
(`library(foreign)`), reading of GIS-Shapefiles
(`library(shapefiles)`), and to read even sound files or pictures.

## Direct input

We used this method already when creating vectors with the `c`
(combine)-Function:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, 5, 7, 3, 4, 5, 8)
x
```

In the same way it is possible to create other data types like data
frames:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
dat <- data.frame(f = c("a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b"),
                  x = c(1,   4,   3,   3,   5,   7)
       )
dat
```

or matrices:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
A <- matrix(c(1:9), nrow=3)
A
```

We see that a matrix is not much different from a vector, formatted into rows and columns.


## Read data from a text file

**R** has very flexible functions to read data from text files. 
Let's for example use a table that contains some data from a lake area in
north-eastern Germany (Table 1).


**Table 1:** Morphometrical and chemical properties of selected lakes
(S=Stechlinsee, NN=Nehmitzsee Nord, NS=Nehmitzsee Süd, BL=Breiter
Luzin, SL = Schmaler Luzin, DA = Dagowsee, HS = Feldberger
Haussee; z=mean depth (m), t=theoretical retention time (a),
P=phosphorus concentration ($\mathrm{\mu g L^{-1}}$), N=nitrogen concentration ($\mathrm{mg L{^-1}}$),
Chl=chlorophyll concentration ($\mathrm{\mu g L^{-1}}$), PP=annual primary production
($\mathrm{g C m^{-2} a^{-1}}$), SD = secchi depth (m)). The data are an adapted 
and simplified "toy version" taken from @Casper1985 and @Koschel1985. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
lakes <- read.csv("lakes.csv")
kable(lakes)
```

The data can be downloaded from https://github.com/tpetzoldt/datasets/tree/main/data


### Set working directory


**R** needs to know where to find the data on your computer. One way is to 
provide the full path to the data set, e.g. if it is `c:/users/<username>/documents`, then

```{r eval=FALSE}
lakes <- read.csv("c:/users/julia/documents/lakes.csv")
```

This can be cumbersome and error-prone, so the preferred method is to set 
the **working directory** of **R** to the data directory. This can be done 
in **RStudio** like follows:

1. Locate the folder with the data in the "Files" pane
2. Select "More"
3. Select "Set As Working Directory"

![](img/set-working-directory.png)
**Figure2:** Setting the working directory in **RStudio**

After this, data can be retrieved directly from the **working directory **:

```{r eval=TRUE}
lakes <- read.csv("lakes.csv", header=TRUE)
```

We may also consider to create a sub-folder `data` of the working direktory and put the data in.
Then we could use for example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
lakes <- read.csv("data/lakes.csv", header=TRUE)
```


Note also that we use always the ordinary slash "/" and not the backslash "\\", even
on Windows. 


In some countries that have the comma and not the
dot as a decimal separator and then for example a semicolon as column separator, 
additional arguments `dec = ","`, `sep=";"` may be required. The details are found 
on the `read.table` help page.

## Read data from the internet

If the data are available on an internet server, it can be read
directly from there:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
lakes <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpetzoldt/datasets/main/data/lakes.csv")
```

Now, as the data are saved in the data frame `lakes` it is possible to access them as usual:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
lakes
summary(lakes)
boxplot(lakes[-1])
```

Here `summary` shows a quick overview and `boxplot` creates a boxplot for all 
columns except the first, that contains no numbers.

Now, we are ready to inspect the content of this new variable `lakes`. If we use 
**RStudio** a `View` can be invoked by clicking to `lakes` in the environment window.


## "Import Dataset" in RStudio

**RStudio** contains a handy feature that makes importing of data more
convenient.  Essentially, this "Import Dataset" wizard helps us to
construct the correct `read.table`, `read.csv` or `read_delim` function
interactively. It is possible to try
different options until a satisfying result is obtained. Current versions of 
**RStudio** contain several different ways to import data. Here we demonstrate
the "Import Dataset From Text (readr)" assistant:

1. From the menu select: File -- Import DataSet -- From CSV.
2. Select the requested file and select suitable options like the name of the variable the data are to be assigned to, the delimiter character (comma or Tab) and whether the first row of the file contains variable names.

![](img/rstudio-import-readr.png)

Import Dataset From Text (readr) assistant of **RStudio**.

Hint: In the exmple above, the name of the data frame is identical to the file name, i.e. "lakes". If we want to name it differently (e.g.: `dat`), we must not forget to change this setting.

Note also that the Code Preview contains the commands that the wizard created. 
If we copy these commands to the script pane, you can re-read the data several 
times without going back to the menu system:

```{r}
library(readr)
lakes <- read_csv("D:/DATA/lakes.csv")
View(lakes)
```


# Working with Dataframes

## Display the content of the data frame

The easiest way is to just enter the name of the data frame to the **R** console, e.g.:

```{r}
lakes
```

or to click to the name of the data frame in the "Environment" explorer of **RStudio**.
This executes then `View(lakes)`, so that the data are shown.

For large tables it is often not very useful to display the full
content with `View`, so it may be better to use the function `str`
(structure) that gives a compact overview over type, size and content of a variable:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
str(mydata)
```

The `str` function is universal and also suitable for complicated
object types like lists. Of course, there are many more possibilities
for inspecting the content of a variable:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
names(lakes)
mode(lakes)
length(lakes)
```

and sometimes even:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
plot(lakes)
```

## Access single columns with $

Single columns of a data frame can be accessed by using indices (with
`[]`) similar to a vector or a matrix or by using the column name
and the `$`) operator:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
mean(lakes[,2])
mean(lakes$z)
mean(lakes[,"z"])
mean(lakes[["z"]])
plot(lakes$z, lakes$t)
```
where `z` is the mean depth of the lakes and `t` the so-called mean residence time.

We should also nitice the subtle difference of the output of the `[]` and the `[[]]`-
version.  The difference is as follows: single brackets return a data
frame with one column, but double square brackets return the content
of the column as a vector without the caption.

**Warning:** In some older books, the `$`-style is sometimes abbreviated using 
the `attach` and `detach`-functions.
This "prehistoric relict" is strongly discouraged, as it can lead to data 
inconsistency and strange errors. If you find it somewhere where it is still 
used, then it is a good idea to use `detach` repeatedly until an error message 
confirms us that there is nothing else that can be detached. Finally: never use 
`attach/detach` in a package.

Instead, it is much better to use another function `width`, that opens
the data frame only temporarily:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
with(lakes, plot(z, t))
```

## Subsets and logical indices

In the following, we use another data set that we read directly from the internet:

```{r eval=TRUE}
fruits <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpetzoldt/datasets/main/data/clementines.csv")
```

It contains weight, width and height measurements of two brands of Clementine fruits.
After loading the data, we look at it with `View(fruits)` or the Environment explorer of **Rstudio**


A very powerful feature of **R** is the use of logical vectors as
"indices", with similar results like data base queries. As an example, we can show 
the weight of all fruits of brand "A" with

```{r eval=TRUE}
fruits[fruits$brand == "A", c("brand", "weight")]
```
Here the first indext in the square brackets indicates the subset of rows that we want and the second argument the columns. If we want to see all columns, we leave the argument after the comma empty:

```{r eval=TRUE}
fruits[fruits$brand == "A", ]
```

A logical comparison requires always a double "`==`".
Logical operations like `&` (and) and `|` (or) are also
possible.  Note that "and" has always precedence before
"or", except this is changed with parenthesis.

A subset of a data frame can also be extracted with the
`subset` function:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
brand_B <- subset(fruits, brand == "B")
brand_B
```

Like in the example before, the condition argument allows also logical
expressions with `&` (and) and `|` (or).

We can also access single elements in matrix-like manner. 

The element from the 2nd row and the 4th column can be selected with:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
fruits[2, 4]
```

the complete 5th row with:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
fruits[5, ]
```

and rows 5:10 of the 4th column (`weight`) with:

```{r fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, keep.source=TRUE}
fruits[5:10, 4]
```


Additional methods for working with matrices, data frames and lists can
be found in **R** textbooks or in the official **R** documentation.

## Pipelines and summaries

The last examples are intended to demonstrate how powerful a single
line can be in **R**. How to analyse data sets evolved over the history of **R**, so there is for example a function `aggregate` to compute statistics (e.g. mean values) depending on given criteria.

This works well and is still used, but the modern methods are more compact and 
easier to understand. Here let's introduce a modern concept first, that is called
"pipelining". The idea is, that the result of a function is directly pipelined to 
another function, so instead of writing:

```{r}
brand_B <- subset(fruits, brand == "B")
columns_B <- brand_B[c("weight", "width", "height")]
means_B <- colMeans(columns_B)
means_B
```

we can directly write:

```{r}
library("dplyr")
fruits |> filter(brand == "B") |> select(weight, width, height) |> colMeans()
```

Here we load an add-on package *dplyr* first, that contains a lot of helpful functions 
for data management, for example `filter` that selects rows and `select` that selects columns.
The pipeline operator `|>` pipes then the data set `fruits`to the `filter`- function and subsequently to the next. The "native pipeline operator" `|>` was introduced with **R** 4.1. As an alternative
we can also use the `%>%` pipeline operator, that is loaded by the **dplyr** package. 
Its function would be identical in this case.

Two other extremely useful **dplyr** functions are `group_by` and `summary`, 
that allow to calculate arbitrary summary statistics in dependence of grouping variables. 
If we use the `brand` for grouping, we can summarize all groups simultaneously:

```{r}
fruits |> 
  group_by(brand) |>
  summarise(mean(weight), mean(width), mean(height))
```

The `summarize` line above can still be made better, and there plenty of other 
stunning possibilities, so we will come back to this later.


## Output of Results

The most simple method to save outputs from **R** is to copy
it directly from the **R** console to any other program (e.g.
LibreOffice, Microsoft Word or Powerpoint) via the Clipboard.
This is convenient, but cannot be automated. Therefore, it
is better to use a programmatic approach.

Let's use the example before and store the results in a new data frame `results`:

```{r eval=TRUE}
results <-
  fruits |> 
  group_by(brand) |>
  summarise(mean(weight), mean(width), mean(height))
```

Data frames can be saved as text files with `write.table`, `write.csv` or `write_csv`. 
Here we use `write_csv` (with underscore, not dot) from package **readr**:

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library("readr")
write_csv(results, file="output-data.csv")
```

In addition to these basic functions **R** has a wealth of
possibilities to save output and data for later use in reports and
presentations. All of them are of course documented in the online
help, e.g.  `print`, `print.table`, `cat` for text files, and 
`pdf`, `png` for figures. The add-on packages
**xtable** contains functions for creating **LaTeX** or
HTML-tables while full HTML output is supported by the `R2HTML` or `knitr`
packages.

## Plots with ggplot2

In addition to the plot functions we used so far, other plot packages exist, for example **lattice** or **ggplot2**. Here a few small examples with the very popular **ggplot2* package:

```{r eval=TRUE, plot=TRUE, fig.height=3}
library("ggplot2")
fruits |>
  ggplot(aes(brand, weight)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Or a scatterplot to compare weight and width of the fruits

```{r eval=TRUE, plot=TRUE, fig.height=3}
fruits |> ggplot(aes(weight, width)) + geom_point(aes(color=brand))
```

where the brand is indicated as color. Another option could be:

```{r eval=TRUE, plot=TRUE, fig.height=3}
fruits |> ggplot(aes(weight, width)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") + 
  facet_grid(~brand)
```


## Exercises

**R** contains lots of data sets for exploring its graphical and
statistical functions and that can be activated by using the
data function, e.g.  `data(iris)` or `data(cars)`. A description of the
data set can be found as usual in the help files, e.g. `?iris`, `?cars`.

Use one of these data sets and try

1. ways to access columns, to select rows and to create subsets
2. ways for summary statistics and visualization with **R's** base plot functions and optionally with `ggplot`.
